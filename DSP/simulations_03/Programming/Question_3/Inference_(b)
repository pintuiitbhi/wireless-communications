(1.) Magnitude curve is symmetric about the y-axis.
(2.) Phase spectrum is symmetric about the origin.
(3.) It is observed that on increasing the value of M for averaging system , we get the low frequency signal as output. 

It implies that on increasing the length of averaging system sound will become  flatter ie. lower in pitch
